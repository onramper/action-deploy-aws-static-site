     * select the indicated environment (recommended for production stacks), or to
     * the values of environment variables
     * `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`/`CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` to let the target environment
     * depend on the AWS credentials/configuration that the CDK CLI is executed
     * under (recommended for development stacks).
     *
     * If the `Stack` is instantiated inside a `Stage`, any undefined

     * advantage of all features of the CDK. For example, they will not be able to

     * automatically translate Service Principals to the right format based on the
     * environment's AWS partition, and other such enhancements.

     *
     * Here is how the process works. Let's say there are two stacks,
     * `producerStack` and `consumerStack`, and `producerStack` has a bucket
     * called `bucket`, which is referenced by `consumerStack` (perhaps because
     * an AWS Lambda Function writes into it, or something like that).
     *
     * It is not safe to remove `producerStack.bucket` because as the bucket is being
     * deleted, `consumerStack` might still be using it.
     *
     * Instead, the process takes two deployments:
     *
     * ### Deployment 1: break the relationship
     *
     * - Make sure `consumerStack` no longer references `bucket.bucketName` (maybe the consumer
     *   stack now uses its own bucket, or it writes to an AWS DynamoDB table, or maybe you just
     *   remove the Lambda Function altogether).
     * - In the `ProducerStack` class, call `this.exportValue(this.bucket.bucketName)`. This
     *   will make sure the CloudFormation Export continues to exist while the relationship
     *   between the two stacks is being broken.
     * - Deploy (this will effectively only change the `consumerStack`, but it's safe to deploy both).
     *
     * ### Deployment 2: remove the bucket resource
     *
     * - You are now free to remove the `bucket` resource from `producerStack`.
     * - Don't forget to remove the `exportValue()` call as well.
     * - Deploy again (this time only the `producerStack` will be changed -- the bucket will be deleted).

     *

     * Returns the naming scheme used to allocate logical IDs. By default, uses
     * the `HashedAddressingScheme` but this method can be overridden to customize
     * this behavior.
     *
     * In order to make sure logical IDs are unique and stable, we hash the resource
     * construct tree path (i.e. toplevel/secondlevel/.../myresource) and add it as
     * a suffix to the path components joined without a separator (CloudFormation
     * IDs only allow alphanumeric characters).
     *
     * The result will be:
     *
     *   <path.join('')><md5(path.join('/')>
     *     "human"      "hash"
     *
     * If the "human" part of the ID exceeds 240 characters, we simply trim it so
     * the total ID doesn't exceed CloudFormation's 255 character limit.
     *
     * We only take 8 characters from the md5 hash (0.000005 chance of collision).
     *
     * Special cases:
     *
     * - If the path only contains a single component (i.e. it's a top-level
     *   resource), we won't add the hash to it. The hash is not needed for
     *   disambiguation and also, it allows for a more straightforward migration an
     *   existing CloudFormation template to a CDK stack without logical ID changes
     *   (or renames).
     * - For aesthetic reasons, if the last components of the path are the same
     *   (i.e. `L1/L2/Pipeline/Pipeline`), they will be de-duplicated to make the
     *   resulting human portion of the ID more pleasing: `L1L2Pipeline<HASH>`
     *   instead of `L1L2PipelinePipeline<HASH>`
     * - If a component is named "Default" it will be omitted from the path. This
     *   allows refactoring higher level abstractions around constructs without affecting
     *   the IDs of already deployed resources.
     * - If a component is named "Resource" it will be omitted from the user-visible
     *   path, but included in the hash. This reduces visual noise in the human readable
     *   part of the identifier.
