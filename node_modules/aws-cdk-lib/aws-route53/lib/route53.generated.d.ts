 *
 * > You can't create a health check with simple routing.
 *
 * *ELB Load Balancers*
 *
 * If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.
 *
 * *Private Hosted Zones*
 *
 * You can associate health checks with failover records in a private hosted zone. Note the following:
 *
 * - Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
 * - You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.
 * - You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) .

         * *If you specify a value for* `IPAddress` :
         *
         * Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
         *
         * When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the `Host` header:
         *
         * - If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type` , Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
         * - If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type` , Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
         * - If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP` for `Type` , Route 53 passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
         *
         * If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , Route 53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of the preceding cases.
         *
         * *If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`* :
         *
         * Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval that you specify for `RequestInterval` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
         *
         * > If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no record with a type of A for the name that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.
         *
         * If you want to check the health of multiple records that have the same name and type, such as multiple weighted records, and if you choose to specify the endpoint only by `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the records (www.example.com).
         *
         * > In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the records and you then associate the health check with those records, health check results will be unpredictable.
         *
         * In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP` , `HTTPS` , `HTTP_STR_MATCH` , or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` , Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you specify a value for `IPAddress` . If the value of `Type` is `TCP` , Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

         * - *CALCULATED* : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of `HealthThreshold` .
         * - *RECOVERY_CONTROL* : The health check is assocated with a Route53 Application Recovery Controller routing control. If the routing control state is `ON` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is `OFF` , the health check is considered unhealthy.

You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).
 *
 * > You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets.
 *
 * For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) .
 *
 * Note the following:
 *
 * - You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com.
 * - If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information, see [Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
 *
 * When you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request, the initial status of the hosted zone is `PENDING` . For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to `INSYNC` .
 *
 * The `CreateHostedZone` request requires the caller to have an `ec2:DescribeVpcs` permission.
 *
 * > When creating private hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition where the hosted zone is created. A partition is a group of AWS Regions . Each AWS account is scoped to one partition.
 * >
 * > The following are the supported partitions:
 * >
 * > - `aws` - AWS Regions
 * > - `aws-cn` - China Regions
 * > - `aws-us-gov` - AWS GovCloud (US) Region

     *
     * - **Log Group and Resource Policy** - Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations.
     *
     * > If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.
     *
     * - Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:
     *
     * - You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.
     * - You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.
     * - When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:
     *
     * `/aws/route53/ *hosted zone name*`
     *
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.
     * - Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of `Resource` , specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with `*` , for example:
     *
     * `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`
     *
     * To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the following values:
     *
     * - For `aws:SourceArn` , supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID` .
     * - For `aws:SourceAccount` , supply the account ID for the account that creates the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111` .
     *
     * For more information, see [The confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the *AWS IAM User Guide* .
     *
     * > You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI .
     * - **Log Streams and Edge Locations** - When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:
     *
     * - Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location.
     * - Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
     *
     * The name of each log stream is in the following format:
     *
     * `*hosted zone ID* / *edge location code*`
     *
     * The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the [Route 53 Product Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.
     * - **Queries That Are Logged** - Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see [Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * - **Log File Format** - For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value, see [Logging DNS Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
     * - **Pricing** - For information about charges for query logs, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) .
     * - **How to Stop Logging** - If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs, delete the query logging configuration. For more information, see [DeleteQueryLoggingConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteQueryLoggingConfig.html) .

You can get the value of `DnsName` using the AWS CLI command [describe-vpc-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html) .
         * - **CloudFront distribution** - Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.
         *
         * Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. For example, if the name of the record is *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see [Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environment** - If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name `my-environment. *us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com` is a regionalized domain name.
         *
         * > For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
         *
         * For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the `CNAME` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:

         * - **ELB load balancer** - Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console , the ELB API, or the AWS CLI .
         *
         * - *AWS Management Console* : Go to the EC2 page, choose *Load Balancers* in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the *Description* tab, and get the value of the *DNS name* field.

         * - **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains** - If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in `DNSName` and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
         *
         * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
         * - **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
         *
         * - *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:
         *
         * - For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
         *
         * > When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
         * - **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
         * - **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target.

     *
     * > Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported.
     *
     * If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region.

     * - By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
     * - By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)

     *
     * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
     *
     * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:
     *
     * - *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     * - *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
     *
     * - You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
     * - You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
     * - You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     *
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     *
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
     *
     * > The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
     *
     * *Geolocation Routing*
     *
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
     *
     * - The United States
     * - North America
     * - The default resource record set
     *
     * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
     *
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
     *
     * > Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     * >
     * > - Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.
     * > - Associate that health check with the resource record set.

         * *When to Specify HealthCheckId*
         *
         * Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:
         *
         * - *Non-alias resource record sets* : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.
         *
         * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
         *
         * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.
         *
         * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
         * - *Alias resource record sets* : You specify the following settings:
         *
         * - You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
         * - You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
         * - You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
         *
         * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
         *
         * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
         *
         * > The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
         *
         * *Geolocation Routing*
         *
         * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for `CountryCode` is `*` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
         *
         * - The United States
         * - North America
         * - The default resource record set
         *
         * *Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name*
         *
         * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is serving content for `www.example.com` . For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` , specify the domain name of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com` ), not the name of the resource record sets ( `www.example.com` ).
         *
         * > Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
         * >
         * > - Create a health check that has the same value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.
         * > - Associate that health check with the resource record set.

         * *Applies only to alias records with any routing policy:* When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is `true` , an alias record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or another record in the hosted zone.
         *
         * Note the following:
         *
         * - **CloudFront distributions** - You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
         * - **Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains** - If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in `DNSName` and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.
         *
         * If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.
         * - **ELB load balancers** - Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
         *
         * - *Classic Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in `DNSName` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - *Application and Network Load Balancers* : If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` , Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:
         *
         * - For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
         * - A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
         *
         * > When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
         * - **S3 buckets** - There are no special requirements for setting `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
         * - **Other records in the same hosted zone** - If the AWS resource that you specify in `DNSName` is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information, see [What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .
         *
