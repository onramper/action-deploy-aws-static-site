Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.

The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:
         *
         * - *Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:* Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.
         * - *Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:* Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.
         *
         * On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as `0` , which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.
