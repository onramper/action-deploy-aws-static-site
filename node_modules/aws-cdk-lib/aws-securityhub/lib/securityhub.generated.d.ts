         *
         * - To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
         * - To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
         * - To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesn't match.
         *
         * `CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.
         *
         * To search for values that don’t have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
         *
         * - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
         * - To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
         * - To search for values that don't start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .
         *

For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.
         *
         * You can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can't provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

         *
         * For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .
         *
         * - `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
         * - `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
