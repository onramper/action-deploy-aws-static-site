/**
 * A *schedule* is the main resource you create, configure, and manage using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler.
 *
 * Every schedule has a *schedule expression* that determines when, and with what frequency, the schedule runs. EventBridge Scheduler supports three types of schedules: rate, cron, and one-time schedules. For more information about different schedule types, see [Schedule types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/schedule-types.html) in the *EventBridge Scheduler User Guide* .
 *
 * When you create a schedule, you configure a target for the schedule to invoke. A target is an API operation that EventBridge Scheduler calls on your behalf every time your schedule runs. EventBridge Scheduler supports two types of targets: *templated* targets invoke common API operations across a core groups of services, and customizeable *universal* targets that you can use to call more than 6,000 operations across over 270 services. For more information about configuring targets, see [Managing targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/managing-targets.html) in the *EventBridge Scheduler User Guide* .
 *
 * For more information about managing schedules, changing the schedule state, setting up flexible time windows, and configuring a dead-letter queue for a schedule, see [Managing a schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/managing-schedule.html) in the *EventBridge Scheduler User Guide* .
