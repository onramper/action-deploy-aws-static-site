 * Safety rules in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller let you add safeguards around changing routing control states, and enabling and disabling routing controls, to help prevent unwanted outcomes. Note that the name of a safety rule must be unique within a control panel.
 *
 * There are two types of safety rules in Route 53 ARC: assertion rules and gating rules.

For example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control state is `On` after the transaction completes so that traffic continues to be directed to at least one cell for the application. This prevents a fail-open scenario.
 *
 * Gating rule: A gating rule lets you configure a gating routing control as an overall on-off switch for a group of routing controls. Or, you can configure more complex gating scenarios, for example, by configuring multiple gating routing controls.
