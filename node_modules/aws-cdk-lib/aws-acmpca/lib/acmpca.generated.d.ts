     * Your private certificate authority (CA) creates base CRLs. Delta CRLs are not supported. You can enable CRLs for your new or an existing private CA by setting the *Enabled* parameter to `true` . Your private CA writes CRLs to an S3 bucket that you specify in the *S3BucketName* parameter. You can hide the name of your bucket by specifying a value for the *CustomCname* parameter. Your private CA copies the CNAME or the S3 bucket name to the *CRL Distribution Points* extension of each certificate it issues. Your S3 bucket policy must give write permission to AWS Private CA.
     *
     * AWS Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see [Encrypting Your CRLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaCreateCa.html#crl-encryption) .
     *
     * Your private CA uses the value in the *ExpirationInDays* parameter to calculate the *nextUpdate* field in the CRL. The CRL is refreshed prior to a certificate's expiration date or when a certificate is revoked. When a certificate is revoked, it appears in the CRL until the certificate expires, and then in one additional CRL after expiration, and it always appears in the audit report.
     *
     * A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is revoked. If for any reason a CRL update fails, AWS Private CA makes further attempts every 15 minutes.
     *
     * CRLs contain the following fields:
     *
     * - *Version* : The current version number defined in RFC 5280 is V2. The integer value is 0x1.
     * - *Signature Algorithm* : The name of the algorithm used to sign the CRL.
     * - *Issuer* : The X.500 distinguished name of your private CA that issued the CRL.
     * - *Last Update* : The issue date and time of this CRL.
     * - *Next Update* : The day and time by which the next CRL will be issued.
     * - *Revoked Certificates* : List of revoked certificates. Each list item contains the following information.
     *
     * - *Serial Number* : The serial number, in hexadecimal format, of the revoked certificate.
     * - *Revocation Date* : Date and time the certificate was revoked.
     * - *CRL Entry Extensions* : Optional extensions for the CRL entry.
     *
     * - *X509v3 CRL Reason Code* : Reason the certificate was revoked.
     * - *CRL Extensions* : Optional extensions for the CRL.
     *
     * - *X509v3 Authority Key Identifier* : Identifies the public key associated with the private key used to sign the certificate.
     * - *X509v3 CRL Number:* : Decimal sequence number for the CRL.
     * - *Signature Algorithm* : Algorithm used by your private CA to sign the CRL.
     * - *Signature Value* : Signature computed over the CRL.
     *
     * Certificate revocation lists created by AWS Private CA are DER-encoded. You can use the following OpenSSL command to list a CRL.
     *
     * `openssl crl -inform DER -text -in *crl_path* -noout`
