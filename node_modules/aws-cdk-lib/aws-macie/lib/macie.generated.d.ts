/**
 * The `AWS::Macie::AllowList` resource specifies an allow list.
 *
 * In Amazon Macie , an allow list defines specific text or a text pattern for Macie to ignore when it inspects data sources for sensitive data. If data matches text or a text pattern in an allow list, Macie doesn’t report the data in sensitive data findings or sensitive data discovery results, even if the data matches the criteria of a custom data identifier or a managed data identifier. You can create and use allow lists in all the AWS Regions where Macie is currently available except the Asia Pacific (Osaka) Region.
 *
 * Macie supports two types of allow lists:
 *
 * - *Predefined text* - For this type of list ( `S3WordsList` ), you create a line-delimited plaintext file that lists specific text to ignore, and you store the file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) bucket. You then configure settings for Macie to access the list in the bucket.
 *
 * This type of list typically contains specific words, phrases, and other kinds of character sequences that aren’t sensitive, aren't likely to change, and don’t necessarily adhere to a common pattern. If you use this type of list, Macie doesn't report occurrences of text that exactly match a complete entry in the list. Macie treats each entry in the list as a string literal value. Matches aren't case sensitive.
 * - *Regular expression* - For this type of list ( `Regex` ), you specify a regular expression that defines a text pattern to ignore. Unlike an allow list with predefined text, you store the regex and all other list settings in Macie .
 *
 * This type of list is helpful if you want to specify text that isn’t sensitive but varies or is likely to change while also adhering to a common pattern. If you use this type of list, Macie doesn't report occurrences of text that completely match the pattern defined by the list.
 *
 * For more information, see [Defining sensitive data exceptions with allow lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/allow-lists.html) in the *Amazon Macie User Guide* .
 *
 * An `AWS::Macie::Session` resource must exist for an AWS account before you can create an `AWS::Macie::AllowList` resource for the account. Use a [DependsOn attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html) to ensure that an `AWS::Macie::Session` resource is created before other Macie resources are created for an account. For example, `"DependsOn": "Session"` .

If the list's criteria specify a regular expression ( `Regex` ), this value is typically `OK` . Macie can compile the expression. If the list's criteria specify an Amazon S3 object ( `S3WordsList` ), possible values are:
     *
     * - `OK` - Macie can retrieve and parse the contents of the object.
     * - `S3_OBJECT_ACCESS_DENIED` - Macie isn't allowed to access the object or the object is encrypted with a customer managed AWS KMS key that Macie isn't allowed to use. Check the bucket policy and other permissions settings for the bucket and the object. If the object is encrypted, also ensure that it's encrypted with a key that Macie is allowed to use.
     * - `S3_OBJECT_EMPTY` - Macie can retrieve the object but the object doesn't contain any content. Ensure that the object contains the correct entries. Also ensure that the list's criteria specify the correct bucket and object names.
     * - `S3_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` - The object doesn't exist in Amazon S3 . Ensure that the list's criteria specify the correct bucket and object names.
     * - `S3_OBJECT_OVERSIZE` - Macie can retrieve the object. However, the object contains too many entries or its storage size exceeds the quota for an allow list. Try breaking the list into multiple files and ensure that each file doesn't exceed any quotas. Then configure list settings in Macie for each file.
     * - `S3_THROTTLED` - Amazon S3 throttled the request to retrieve the object. Wait a few minutes and then try again.
     * - `S3_USER_ACCESS_DENIED` - Amazon S3 denied the request to retrieve the object. If the specified object exists, you're not allowed to access it or it's encrypted with an AWS KMS key that you're not allowed to use. Work with your AWS administrator to ensure that the list's criteria specify the correct bucket and object names, and you have read access to the bucket and the object. If the object is encrypted, also ensure that it's encrypted with a key that you're allowed to use.
     * - `UNKNOWN_ERROR` - A transient or internal error occurred when Macie attempted to retrieve or parse the object. Wait a few minutes and then try again. A list can also have this status if it's encrypted with a key that Amazon S3 and Macie can't access or use.
