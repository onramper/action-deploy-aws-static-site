 * Specify an AWS App Runner Automatic Scaling configuration by using the `AWS::AppRunner::AutoScalingConfiguration` resource in an AWS CloudFormation template.
 *
 * The `AWS::AppRunner::AutoScalingConfiguration` resource is an AWS App Runner resource type that specifies an App Runner automatic scaling configuration.
 *
 * App Runner requires this resource to set non-default auto scaling settings for instances used to process the web requests. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.
 *
 * Create multiple revisions of a configuration by calling this action multiple times using the same `AutoScalingConfigurationName` . The call returns incremental `AutoScalingConfigurationRevision` values. When you create a service and configure an auto scaling configuration resource, the service uses the latest active revision of the auto scaling configuration by default. You can optionally configure the service to use a specific revision.
 *
 * Configure a higher `MinSize` to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the AWS Region . The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.
 *
 * Configure a lower `MaxSize` to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.
