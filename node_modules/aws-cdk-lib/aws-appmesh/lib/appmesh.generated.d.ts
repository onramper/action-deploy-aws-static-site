/**
 * Creates a virtual node within a service mesh.
 *
 * A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the service discovery information for your task group, and whether the proxy running in a task group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
 *
 * You define a `listener` for any inbound traffic that your virtual node expects. Any virtual service that your virtual node expects to communicate to is specified as a `backend` .
 *
 * The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the `arn` that is associated with the virtual node. Set this value to the full ARN; for example, `arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:123456789012:myMesh/default/virtualNode/myApp` ) as the `APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN` environment variable for your task group's Envoy proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the `node.id` and `node.cluster` Envoy parameters.
 *
 * > By default, App Mesh uses the name of the resource you specified in `APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN` when Envoy is referring to itself in metrics and traces. You can override this behavior by setting the `APPMESH_RESOURCE_CLUSTER` environment variable with your own name.
 *
 * For more information about virtual nodes, see [Virtual nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_nodes.html) . You must be using `1.15.0` or later of the Envoy image when setting these variables. For more information about App Mesh Envoy variables, see [Envoy image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html) in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.
