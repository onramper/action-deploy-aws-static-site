 * Specifies an identity for using within SES.

By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity.
 *
 * When you verify an email address, SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email. When you verify a domain without specifying the DkimSigningAttributes properties, OR only the NextSigningKeyLength property of DkimSigningAttributes, this resource provides a set of CNAME token names and values (DkimDNSTokenName1, DkimDNSTokenValue1, DkimDNSTokenName2, DkimDNSTokenValue2, DkimDNSTokenName3, DkimDNSTokenValue3) as outputs. You can then add these to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as Easy DKIM.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your resource must include DkimSigningAttributes properties DomainSigningSelector and DomainSigningPrivateKey. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (DomainSigningSelector) (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key (DomainSigningPrivateKey).
 *
 * Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the email identity that you're verifying.
