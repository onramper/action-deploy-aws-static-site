         * - *`resources.ARN`* - You can use any operator with `resources.ARN` , but if you use `Equals` or `NotEquals` , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciÔ¨Åed in the template as the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals `AWS::S3::Object` , the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the `StartsWith` operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value.

     * Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail.

     * By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.
