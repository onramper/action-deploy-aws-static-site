     * Checks if `art` is an instance of this class.

     * Use this method instead of `instanceof` to properly detect `CloudFormationStackArtifact`
     * instances, even when the construct library is symlinked.
     *
     * Explanation: in JavaScript, multiple copies of the `cx-api` library on
     * disk are seen as independent, completely different libraries. As a
     * consequence, the class `CloudFormationStackArtifact` in each copy of the `cx-api` library
     * is seen as a different class, and an instance of one class will not test as
     * `instanceof` the other class. `npm install` will not create installations
     * like this, but users may manually symlink construct libraries together or
     * use a monorepo tool: in those cases, multiple copies of the `cx-api`
     * library can be accidentally installed, and `instanceof` will behave
     * unpredictably. It is safest to avoid using `instanceof`, and using
     * this type-testing method instead.
