     * - For each attribute, the applicable value.
     *
     * Supported attribute keys include the following:
     *
     * - **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME** - If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see [AliasTarget->DNSName](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-DNSName) in the *Route 53 API Reference* .
     *
     * Note the following:
     *
     * - The configuration for the service that is specified by `ServiceId` must include settings for an `A` record, an `AAAA` record, or both.
     * - In the service that is specified by `ServiceId` , the value of `RoutingPolicy` must be `WEIGHTED` .
     * - If the service that is specified by `ServiceId` includes `HealthCheckConfig` settings, AWS Cloud Map will create the health check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias record.
     * - Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.
     * - If you specify a value for `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` , don't specify values for any of the `AWS_INSTANCE` attributes.
     * - **AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID** - *HTTP namespaces only.* The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the instance. The `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address. When creating resources with a type of [AWS::ServiceDiscovery::Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-servicediscovery-instance.html) , if the `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute is specified, the only other attribute that can be specified is `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` . After the resource has been created, the `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address.
     * - **AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS** - If the service configuration includes `HealthCheckCustomConfig` , when creating resources with a type of [AWS::ServiceDiscovery::Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-servicediscovery-instance.html) you can optionally use `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` to specify the initial status of the custom health check, `HEALTHY` or `UNHEALTHY` . If you don't specify a value for `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` , the initial status is `HEALTHY` . This attribute can only be used when creating resources and will not be seen on existing resources.
     * - **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME** - If the service configuration includes a `CNAME` record, the domain name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, `example.com` .
     *
     * This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId` includes settings for an `CNAME` record.
     * - **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4** - If the service configuration includes an `A` record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, `192.0.2.44` .
     *
     * This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId` includes settings for an `A` record. If the service includes settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` , `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6` , or both.
     * - **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6** - If the service configuration includes an `AAAA` record, the IPv6 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345` .
     *
     * This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId` includes settings for an `AAAA` record. If the service includes settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` , `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6` , or both.
     * - **AWS_INSTANCE_PORT** - If the service includes an `SRV` record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the port.
     *
     * If the service includes `HealthCheckConfig` , the port on the endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to.
     *
     * This value is required if you specified settings for an `SRV` record or a Route 53 health check when you created the service.

     * A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:
     *
     * - You can't use a health check that's defined by `HealthCheckConfig` because the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)

     * > If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
     *
     * To change the status of a custom health check, submit an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request. AWS Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request.
     *
     * Here's how custom health checks work:
     *
     * - You create a service.
     * - You register an instance.
     * - You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that's associated with the new instance.

     * - Your application submits an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request.
     * - AWS Cloud Map waits for 30 seconds.
     * - If another `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request doesn't arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, AWS Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.

         * - **SRV** - Route 53 returns the value for an `SRV` record. The value for an `SRV` record uses the following values:
         *
         * `priority weight port service-hostname`
         *
         * Note the following about the values:
         *
         * - The values of `priority` and `weight` are both set to `1` and can't be changed.
         * - The value of `port` comes from the value that you specify for the `AWS_INSTANCE_PORT` attribute when you submit a [RegisterInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html) request.
         * - The value of `service-hostname` is a concatenation of the following values:
         *
         * - The value that you specify for `InstanceId` when you register an instance.
         * - The name of the service.
         * - The name of the namespace.
         *
         * For example, if the value of `InstanceId` is `test` , the name of the service is `backend` , and the name of the namespace is `example.com` , the value of `service-hostname` is:
         *
         * `test.backend.example.com`
         *

     *
     * > If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
     *
     * Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For information about pricing for health checks, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) .
     *
     * Note the following about configuring health checks.
     *
     * - **A and AAAA records** - If `DnsConfig` includes configurations for both `A` and `AAAA` records, AWS Cloud Map creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint tthat's specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the `A` and `AAAA` records to be unhealthy.
     * - **CNAME records** - You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type` . If you do, the `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.
     * - **Request interval** - A Route 53 health checker in each health-checking AWS Region sends a health check request to an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. However, health checkers don't coordinate with one another. Therefore, you might sometimes see several requests in one second that's followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.
     * - **Health checking regions** - Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking Regions. For a list of the current Regions, see [Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions) .
     * - **Alias records** - When you register an instance, if you include the `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` attribute, AWS Cloud Map creates a Route 53 alias record. Note the following:
     *
     * - Route 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for alias records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more information, see [EvaluateTargetHealth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth) .
     * - If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn't create the health check.
     * - **Charges for health checks** - Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For information about pricing for health checks, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) .
