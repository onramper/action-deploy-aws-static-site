 *
 * You use an IP set by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the rule statement `IPSetReferenceStatement` , when you add a rule to a rule group or web ACL.

 *
 * As part of the association, you can specify parts of the standard logging fields to keep out of the logs and you can specify filters so that you log only a subset of the logging records.
 *
 * > You can define one logging destination per web ACL.
 *
 * You can access information about the traffic that AWS WAF inspects using the following steps:
 *
 * - Create your logging destination. You can use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
 *
 * The name that you give the destination must start with `aws-waf-logs-` . Depending on the type of destination, you might need to configure additional settings or permissions.
 *
 * For configuration requirements and pricing information for each destination type, see [Logging web ACL traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
 * - Associate your logging destination to your web ACL using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request.
 *
 * When you successfully enable logging using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request, AWS WAF creates an additional role or policy that is required to write logs to the logging destination. For an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, AWS WAF creates a resource policy on the log group. For an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS WAF creates a bucket policy. For an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS WAF creates a service-linked role.

         *
         * The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.
         *
         * You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.
         *
         * Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.
         *
         * For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:
         *
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
         * - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
         *
         * The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:
         *
         * - If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
         *
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
         * - IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
         * - If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
         *
         * - HTTP method POST: count 2
         * - HTTP method GET: count 2
         * - If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
         *
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
         * - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1
         *
         * For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.
         *
         * You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.
         *
         * You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
         *
         * For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
         *
         * If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.
         *
         * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

     * For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.
     *
     * You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.
     *
     * You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
     *
     * For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
     *
     * If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.
     *
     * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

         *

         *
         * Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.
         *
         * For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:
         *
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
         *
         * The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:
         *
         * - If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
         *
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
         * - IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
         * - If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
         *
         * - HTTP method POST: count 2
         * - HTTP method GET: count 2
         * - If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
         *
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
         * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
         * - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1
         *
         * For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.
         *
         * You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.
         *
         * You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
         *
         * For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
         *
         * If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.
         *
         * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

         * AWS WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. If the body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only forwards the contents that are below the limit to AWS WAF for inspection.
         *
         * The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For CloudFront distributions, you can increase the limit in the web ACL `AssociationConfig` , for additional processing fees.
         *
         * The options for oversize handling are the following:
         *
         * - `CONTINUE` - Inspect the available body contents normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.
         * - `MATCH` - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. AWS WAF applies the rule action to the request.
         * - `NO_MATCH` - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
         *
         * You can combine the `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH` settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over the limit.
         *
         * Default: `CONTINUE`

     * A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate.
     *
     * The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.
     *
     * You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.
     *
     * Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.
     *
     * For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:
     *
     * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
     * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
     * - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
     * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
     *
     * The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:
     *
     * - If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
     *
     * - IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
     * - IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
     * - If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
     *
     * - HTTP method POST: count 2
     * - HTTP method GET: count 2
     * - If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
     *
     * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
     * - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
     * - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1
     *
     * For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.
     *
     * You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.
     *
     * You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
     *
     * For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
     *
     * If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.
     *
     * AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

/**
 * > This is the latest version of *AWS WAF* , named AWS WAF V2, released in November, 2019.
 *
 * For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) .
 *
 * Use a web ACL association to define an association between a web ACL and a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AWS AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an AWS App Runner service, or an AWS Verified Access instance.
 *
 * For Amazon CloudFront , don't use this resource. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL with a distribution, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the `WebACL` to your CloudFront distribution configuration. To disassociate a web ACL, provide an empty ARN. For information, see [AWS::CloudFront::Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-distribution.html) .
 *
 * When you create a web ACL or make changes to a web ACL or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, AWS WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an AWS resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.
