     * With AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths` . We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for `--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt` , parent directory is `/bucket/dir/` ) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the `AccessRole` needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the `StartFileTransfer` request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with `StartFileTransfer` .
     *
     * If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the AWS managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission for that key.
     *

     * With AS2, you can send files by calling `StartFileTransfer` and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, `SendFilePaths` .

     * If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission for the secret.

         *
         * The `AUTO` and `0.0.0.0` are special values for the `PassiveIp` parameter. The value `PassiveIp=AUTO` is assigned by default to FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the `PassiveIp` parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` . This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response. FileZilla and WinSCP do support it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your client supports the `PassiveIp=0.0.0.0` response.
